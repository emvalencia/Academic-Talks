-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Question: is there a difference betweeen simulated pain and real pain? Yes
- Can a machine be conscious?
  - Should be possible for a machine to experience: consciousness (conscious awareness),  free will, pain, joy 
  - Consciousness is a property of all properly organized computer systems wheter made of flesh and blood or metal
    and silicon
- Conscious turing machine: gross simplification of a real brain 
  o Not trying to get exact model of brain but rather to understand consciousness 
  o Bernard Baars: consciousness is the activity of actors in a play
    - Baars' model of consciousess (informal): https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00200/full
  o Conscious turing machine: external input (read only), short term memory (read/write), external output (write only)
    - Fast broadcast: binary tree, info is quickly received by all processors
    - Different processors are in charge of different aspects of memory: pain/joy/fear
    - Why is short-term memory so small? 
    - How does info go up? Processors have info to go up tree but very little can go up, what do you choose?
      o Only a few pain receptors = little pain, many pain receptors activated = more pain
        - Can be represented numerically 
        - There are connections, but not everything can be connected to one another 
        - If you're experiencing pain and joy, the numbers add up. Joy reduces the pain
    - How to build it?
      o Memory of faces -> if you see this face, experience fear 
      o Links between certain connections
      o Not a finite state machine 
- Oliver Sacks and the bull example
  o Short-term memory (STM) screams fear
  o Long-term memory (LTM) processors concentrate on fear
  o Fight and flight
  o Flight wins
  o Had all processors on stage fixed on fear, not given access to the stage, wouldn't have moved
  o Tore ligaments as he was running but didn't experience pain until after his extreme fear subsided 
- Architecture
  o Enormous LTM
  o Tiny STEM
  o Concsiousness: every processor in our brain is aware of what's going on in memory
    - Consciousness is awarenesss by all processors of all activity on stage
    - Arises because of the activity on the stage
  o Which LTM processors are necessary for consciousness?
    - Necessary: inner speech, self-awareness (actor representing the conscious entity), motivation (desire and energy)
      o Desire for food/energy (robots need to be charged, humans need food)
    - Questionable: procedural memory creation
    - Do not need: declarative memory creation, language for outer speech, face recognition, emotions 
      o Not all people have these but are still conscious!
        - Late Alzheimer's patients are still conscious
      o Animals also have the necessary processors for consciousness 
        - Rats in a maze can plan where it goes next, dogs want to please (motivation), have a way of planning 
          something they want to do (inner speech- the ability to plan), self-awareness (distinguish yourself
          from the rest of the world)
- Free will paradox
  o De Rerum Natura, 1st century B.C. by Lucretius 
  o "All theory is agaisnt the freedom of the will; all experience is for it." - Dr. Samuel Johnson 
  o Consciousness and the Brain - Stanislas Dehaene 
    - Consider a chess position: actor is chess player and recognizes his or her choice of possible moves
    - No randomness or quantum physics
- How to engineer a machine
  o Assume: physical explanations for consciousness is possible 
  o Why engineer a machine to feel pain? 
    - It's expensive, you want it to take care of itself
    - Make the machine feel pain when it sees you in pain
    - To understand teh problem of simulating vs. experiencing pain, must distinguish insensitivity to pain from
      indifference to pain 
    - Pain asymbolia - condition in which pain is experienced without unpleastantness; these people are like robots
      that can show that they are in pain but do not feel pain 
  o How to engineer extreme pain
    - Under severe pain, you can't do much else
    - Any processor that tries to get on the stage is pushed away, you cannot think of anything else but the pain
    - Doesn't work to experience pain: make reactions to pain automatic (finger away from flame), generate sweat and
      heart rate increases
    - Is loss of control enough? Does a machine feel real pain when it loses free will and is forced to pay attention
      to the pain?
    - At a hospital you can represent pain numerically on a scale of 1-10, there exists a max integer of pain (10)
      o At highest level, can only focus on pain 
    - Small amounts of pain take away small amounts of free will, large take away large amounts 
  o How to engineer fear
    - Much like pain
  o How to engineer joy
   - Cannot explain joy the way you explain pain
   - How does a processor for joy getting on stage give the entity the experience of joy?
   - Joy can be explained as success in the world
   - Explanation for joy: with the absense of negative emotions, the body is in a natural state of joy - a Buddhist idea 
     o Is this the natural state of a robot?
   - Possible solution: In case of great joy, the conscious mind thinks about whatever it wants to think about, can think about
     other things, attention that is free to roam whereever the environment might take it. Built-in 
  o How to engineer motivation?
    - Left hemi-spacial neglect, are not motivated to look at the left side of their world; are unconcsious about what's
      on the left side 
      o Give them a plate of food and they will only eat the right side, even if they are hungry; cannot process right side,
        need to turn the plate around and they will continue to eat
