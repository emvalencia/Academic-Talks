"A Computer Architecture Inspired by Neuroscience, with suggestions for the design of a Conscious AI"

- Is there a difference betweeen simulated pain and real pain? Yes
- Can a machine be conscious?
  - Should be possible for a machine to experience: consciousness (conscious awareness),  free will, pain, joy 
  - Consciousness is a property of all properly organized computer systems wheter made of flesh and blood or metal
    and silicon
- Conscious turing machine: gross simplification of a real brain 
  o Not trying to get exact model of brain but rather to understand consciousness 
  o Bernard Baars: consciousness if the activity of actors in a play
    - Baars' model of consciousess (informal): https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00200/full
  o Conscious turing machine: external input (read only), short term memory (read/write), external output (write only)
